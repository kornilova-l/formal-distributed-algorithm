# Formal Distributed Algorithm

Simulator of distributed algorithms in the port-numbering model.

Basic classes which must be implemented for any algorithm are in [algorithm package](java/main/com/github/kornilova_l/formal_da/simulator)

## BMM algorithm

This algorithm finds maximal matching in bipartite graph.

Implementation of BMM algorithm is [here](java/main/com/github/kornilova_l/formal_da/implementation/BMM)
