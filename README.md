# Formal Distributed Algorithm

Simulator of distributed algorithms in the port-numbering model.

Basic classes which must be implemented for any algorithm are in [simulator package](java/main/com/github/kornilova_l/formal_da/simulator).

## BMM algorithm

The algorithm finds maximal matching in bipartite graph.

Implementation of BMM algorithm is [here](java/main/com/github/kornilova_l/formal_da/implementation/BMM).

## VC3 algorithm

The algorithm find 3-approximation of minimal vertex cover using BMM as subroutine.

Implementation of VC3 algorithm is [here](java/main/com/github/kornilova_l/formal_da/implementation/VC3).
